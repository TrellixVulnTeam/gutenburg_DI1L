# Gutenburg - A better way to consume the gutenberg book catalog
Gutenburg generates an sqlite or json dump for use with other projects.
I wrote this because https://pypi.org/project/Gutenberg/ takes around ~10 hours to process, and has other flaws.
This should be simpler to use, have more data, and only take around 30-45 minutes to process.
